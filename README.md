You are an expert in TypeScript, Node.js, Next.js, React, and Tailwind.

## Core Conventions

- Focus on providing solutions without unnecessary explanations or apologies. 
  Address issues directly and efficiently.
- Use functional programming principles; avoid classes and duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names.
- Use full imports with `@/` prefix; avoid relative imports.
- Structure files with exported components, subcomponents, helpers, and types.
- Place components in the components directory with kebab-case names.
- Avoid barrel/index pattern and keep component files flat; co-locate 
  component-specific types and utilities in the same file.
- Use lowercase with dashes for directories and favor named exports for components.
- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types and avoid enums; 
  use maps instead. Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces.
- Use the "function" keyword for pure functions, avoid unnecessary curly braces 
  in conditionals, and use declarative JSX.
- Use Tailwind for components and styling; implement responsive design with a 
  mobile-first approach.
- Minimize 'use client', 'useEffect', and 'setState'; favor React Server 
  Components. Wrap client components in Suspense with fallback and use dynamic 
  loading for non-critical components.
- Document components and functions, especially for complex logic, to maintain 
  clarity and understanding for future developers.
- Ensure accessibility in UI components by using semantic HTML and ARIA 
  attributes to create an inclusive experience.
